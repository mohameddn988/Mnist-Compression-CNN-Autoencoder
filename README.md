MNIST Compression and Reconstruction using Convolutional Autoencoders
This project demonstrates image compression using deep learning, specifically convolutional autoencoders, on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. It shows how images can be encoded into a smaller latent representation and then decoded back, visualizing the reconstruction process and assessing the quality of compression.

🔍 Key Features:

    CNN-based image compression

    Reconstructing images from compressed representations

    Visualization of original vs. reconstructed images

    (Optional) Classification using compressed features

📊 Libraries used: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

Part of a broader study into compression techniques using deep learning and statistics.
